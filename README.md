# cxe
Civilization IV XML Editor

I made this in February 2013 and I don't remember the details, but anyway, this lets you edit Civilization 4 XMLs for mods in a handy windowed interface.

## Using it
(I think? let me know)
> pip install pyinstaller
> pyinstaller cxe.spec
This should build a dist/cxe.exe or dist/cxe.app, I think, and then you run it.

If not, you should probably look at the PyInstaller docs: http://pythonhosted.org/PyInstaller/#using-spec-files
